        <span class="post-meta">Apr 29, 2015 in cakephp, cakephp3, pagination</span>
        <p>What a complicated title
Okay, agreed. Perhaps an example would be better. Imagine you have a ContentsController which you use in your application to render lots of different types of content. You might have ContentTypes such as News, Guides, Articles, Pages, etc. so there is no point creating lots of controllers, when your ContentsController::index() method could just output the same thing with just different data.

        <p>So what is it?
It’s a plugin for CakePHP 2 and CakePHP 3 which saves you time and energy by automating basic tasks which you would usually write or bake youself. These are the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete), hence the name of the plugin.

So often you have a large collection of collated data, probably with some calculated fields and you want to sort one of the dimensions by a certain value. Pretty hard using regular array methods, unless you start slicing arrays out of their dimension, sort them and inject them back in. We don’t want to do that because it’s fiddly.
