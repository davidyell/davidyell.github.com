<p>My name is Dave and I'm a web developer by trade. I code using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/" title="PHP Storm">PHP Storm</a> in <abbr title="PHP Hypertext Preprocessor" class="initialism">PHP</abbr> and quite often <a href="http://cakephp.org/" title="CakePHP">CakePHP</a>, along with all the other general web bits such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/" title="HTML"><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language" class="initialism">HTML</abbr></a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" title="CSS"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets" class="initialism">CSS</abbr></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/JavaScript" title="Javascript">Javascript</a>. You'll also catch me using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" title="Sass"><abbr title="Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets">Sass</abbr></a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/" title="jQuery">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" title="Twitter Bootstrap">Twitter Bootstrap</a>.</p>
<p>I work on Windows 7, OS X or Ubuntu. It's what you do with it that counts, but it's hard to beat native bash.</p>

<h3>Why this blog?</h3>
<p>So I wanted a place to store thoughts and snippets on coding, technology and other bits. Where better than Github? Where most of my code lives. Sure, I have some over at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/davidyell" title="BitBucket">BitBucket.org</a> also, but that's mostly private work.</p>
<p>I used to have a <a href="http://tiddlywiki.com/" title="TiddlyWiki">TiddlyWiki</a> which lived in my Dropbox, but then I moved a few bits to Github Gists before deciding to create this micro-blog.</p>
